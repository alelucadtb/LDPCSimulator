# LDPC Simulator
The project's main goal is to implement and simulate LDPC error-correcting code, as well as to investigate its decoding complexity and bit error rate for different combinations of decoding cycles and channel model.

Look the [report_LDPC.pdf](report_LDPC.pdf) for a complete comprehension of the code and for the results.
